            <p>Users may accept this Agreement only:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>

              </li>
              <li>
                if such User is a juristic Person, is lawfully existing and has
                all the authorizations, permits and allowances to enter into
                this Agreement and form a binding contract.

            <h2>Provision of the App</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Section 12 of the Public Gambling Act, 1867 provides that
                  games of mere skill are exempt from the application of the
                  Act. The Supreme Court of India and various High Courts in
                  India have opined that a game of mere skill is a game “in
                  which, although the element of chance necessarily cannot be
                  entirely eliminated, success depends principally upon the
                  superior knowledge, training, attention, experience and
                  adroitness of the player. A game of skill is one in which the
                  element of skill predominates over the element of chance.” No
                  penalty can be imposed upon a person for playing such games of
                  skill.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Users and Players must note that Games such as Battlegrounds
                  India, Garena Free Fire, COD Mobile, Ludo, etc. which are
                  available on our platform are ‘Games of Skill’, under Indian
                  law, and that we do not support, endorse or offer users ‘games
                  of chance’ for money. While ‘Games of Skill’ do not have a
                  comprehensive definition, they are those games where the
                  impact of a player’s effort and skill on the outcome of a game
                  is higher than the impact of luck and chance.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  It may be noted that States are permitted, by the Indian
                  Constitution, to enact laws regulating betting and gambling in
                  their respective jurisdictions. In furtherance of these
                  powers, various States have enacted anti- gambling
                  legislations. Such legislations are largely in concert with
                  the Public Gambling Act of 1867 (and include the exception of
                  “games of skill”). Where a state legislation on gambling
                  exists, it prevails over the Public Gambling Act of 1867. In
                  this regard, the Assam Game and Betting Act, 1970 and Orissa
                  (Prevention of) Gambling Act, 1955 and Telangana State Gaming
                  (Amendment) Ordinance and High Court Judgment in Gujarat, 2017
                  prohibits games with money stakes and also does not create an
                  exception for games of skill. Therefore, currently, residents
                  of Assam, Odisha, Telangana and Gujarat are not permitted to
                  play and take part in any events on our platform.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The games rules are clearly defined on this platform and all
                  the users and participants are encouraged to read, understand
                  and follow these rules to be successful in these games.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  The games on our platform are ‘Games of Skills’, such that the
                  outcome / success in the games is directly dependent on the
                  User’s effort, performance and skills. By choosing how to
                  play, the actions of Users shall have direct impact on the
                  game.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Every game will have some elements of chance, but in the form
                  of challenges, obstacles or levels that a User would be able
                  to overcome using his/her skills and knowledge of the game.
                  Elements of luck are present in every game to add thrill and
                  excitement, but no two attempts at a game are identical so
                  Users must use their skills in order to be successful.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Since the games available on our platform can be won through
                  Users’ skills and such skills may be enhanced with practice
                  and experience, the performance of a User may improve with
                  time and practice.
                </p>

              <li>
                <p>
                  Certain games may have pre-determined outcomes (such as in
                  Ludo Board Game), and these outcomes are achievable by Users
                  using their skills.
                </p>

                  These games involves an element of financial risk and may be
